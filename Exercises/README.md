## How to Use

### Option 1: Local Development (Recommended for Offline Work)
1. Download the Exercises.zip file
2. Extract to your local machine
3. Open Code::Blocks (or your preferred C IDE)
4. Create a new project for each exercise
5. Copy the starter code from the exercise .c file
6. Complete the TODOs
7. Compile and test your solution

### Option 2: GitHub Codespaces (Browser-Based)
1. Open the repository in GitHub Codespaces
2. Navigate to this Exercises folder
3. Work on the exercises directly in your browser
4. Use the integrated terminal to compile: `gcc exercise_1.c -o exercise_1`
5. Run: `./exercise_1`

## Tips for Success

- Read the entire README for each exercise before starting
- Look at the function signatures and comments - they guide you
- Test your code with different inputs
- Don't look at solutions until you've tried yourself!
- If stuck, review the theory and examples first

## Compiling and Running

```bash
# Compile
gcc exercise_1.c -o exercise_1

# Run
./exercise_1
```

For exercises using math functions:
```bash
gcc exercise_3.c -o exercise_3 -lm
```

Good luck, and happy coding!
